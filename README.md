## Features
- Smooth scrolling with precise one-card transitions.
- Dynamic styling for the current, above, and below cards.
- Stack-like visual effect for better user experience.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A web browser to test the functionality.

## Technology Choices and Rationale

### Technology Choices
1. **HTML**: Used for creating the structural layout of the card container and individual cards.
2. **CSS**: Applied to style the cards, define their transitions, and ensure responsiveness.
3. **JavaScript**: Implemented to handle the scroll functionality and dynamically manage the card styles based on the userâ€™s scroll interaction.

### Rationale
- **Core Web Technologies**: By relying only on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project remains universally compatible and easy to modify for developers with basic web development skills.
- **Customization**: The use of vanilla JavaScript and CSS allows developers to easily customize animations, card styles, and other features without needing external frameworks.

## Known Limitations and Trade-offs

### Limitations
1. **Scroll Sensitivity**: The feature uses the `wheel` event, which might behave differently based on the device's scroll settings (e.g., on high-sensitivity mice or touchpads).
2. **Accessibility**: The current implementation lacks keyboard navigation or touch gesture support, which limits its usability for some users.

## Future Improvements

1. **Touch and Keyboard Support**: 
   - Add swipe gesture support for mobile and tablet users.
   - Allow navigation using keyboard arrow keys for better accessibility.

2. **Pagination Indicators**:
   - Implement visual indicators (e.g., dots or numbers) to show the current card and enable quick navigation.

3. **Dynamic Card Management**:
   - Introduce support for adding or removing cards dynamically without breaking the functionality.
